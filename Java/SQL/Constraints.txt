SQL **constraints** are used to define rules for the data in a table. Constraints help ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of data in the database. Below is an explanation of the most commonly used SQL constraints, along with examples.

### 1. **PRIMARY KEY Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that each record in a table is uniquely identifiable. A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a database table.
  
- **Properties:**  
  - The primary key column(s) cannot contain `NULL` values.
  - The value in a primary key column must be unique.

- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  In this example, `EmployeeID` is the primary key and must contain unique, non-null values.

### 2. **FOREIGN KEY Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures referential integrity between two tables. It is used to link one table’s column(s) to another table's primary key or unique key.

- **Properties:**  
  - The foreign key column(s) must match the primary or unique key in the referenced table.
  - The foreign key ensures that only values that exist in the referenced table can be inserted into the foreign key column.
  
- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      EmployeeID INT,
      OrderDate DATE,
      FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)
  );
  ```

  Here, `EmployeeID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key that references the `EmployeeID` in the `Employees` table. This enforces that every order must be assigned to an existing employee.

### 3. **UNIQUE Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that all values in a column are unique, but unlike the primary key, the column can contain `NULL` values (depending on the DBMS).

- **Properties:**  
  - Each value in the column must be distinct.
  - Can be applied to multiple columns (composite unique constraint).
  
- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Users (
      UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
      Username VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  Here, `Email` must contain unique values for every user, ensuring no two users have the same email address.

### 4. **NOT NULL Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. It is used to enforce that a field must contain a value.

- **Properties:**  
  - The column must always contain a valid, non-null value.
  
- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Products (
      ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
  );
  ```

  Here, the `ProductName` column must not contain a `NULL` value; every product must have a name.

### 5. **CHECK Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition or set of conditions.

- **Properties:**  
  - The `CHECK` constraint is applied to a column to limit the range or values of the data.
  - It allows enforcing business rules directly in the database.

- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),
      Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
  );
  ```

  Here, the `Age` must be 18 or older, and the `Salary` must be greater than 0. The `CHECK` constraint ensures these conditions are met.

### 6. **DEFAULT Constraint**

- **Purpose:**  
  Specifies a default value for a column when no value is provided during an insert operation.

- **Properties:**  
  - If no value is supplied for the column, the default value is used.
  - The default value can be any literal constant, such as a string, number, or date.

- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      StartDate DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
  );
  ```

  Here, the `StartDate` column will automatically be assigned the current date if no date is provided during the insert.

### 7. **AUTO_INCREMENT (or SERIAL)**

- **Purpose:**  
  Automatically generates a unique value for a column when a new row is inserted. Often used for primary key columns.

- **Properties:**  
  - The value is automatically generated by the database when a new row is added.
  - In some databases (e.g., MySQL), this is specified using `AUTO_INCREMENT`, and in others (e.g., PostgreSQL), it’s defined using `SERIAL`.

- **Example (MySQL):**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

  In this case, the `EmployeeID` will automatically increment with each new record.

### 8. **INDEX**

- **Purpose:**  
  An index is used to speed up the retrieval of rows by creating an ordered structure (usually a B-tree) based on one or more columns in a table.

- **Properties:**  
  - It is used to quickly find rows based on the values of indexed columns.
  - It is not a constraint, but often used alongside primary and foreign keys to improve query performance.

- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
  ```

  Here, an index is created on the `LastName` column to speed up queries that filter or sort based on `LastName`.

### 9. **TRIGGERS**

- **Purpose:**  
  Triggers are not technically a constraint, but they are often used in conjunction with constraints to automatically perform a certain action when a certain event occurs in the database.

- **Properties:**  
  - Triggers are automatic and can be set to execute before or after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation.
  
- **Example (MySQL):**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
  BEFORE INSERT ON Employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      IF NEW.Salary < 0 THEN
          SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary cannot be negative';
      END IF;
  END;
  ```

  Here, a trigger is defined to prevent the insertion of a record with a negative salary.

### 10. **CONSTRAINT Name**

- **Purpose:**  
  You can define a custom name for any constraint for easier identification, especially for composite constraints (those involving multiple columns).

- **Example:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT,
      CustomerID INT,
      OrderDate DATE,
      PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
      CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
  );
  ```

  Here, the `CONSTRAINT fk_customer` gives a custom name (`fk_customer`) to the foreign key constraint.
