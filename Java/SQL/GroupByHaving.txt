### `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` Clauses in SQL

The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are often used together in SQL to organize and filter data based on aggregated results. These clauses allow you to summarize data and apply conditions on aggregated results.

### 1. **`GROUP BY` Clause**

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is typically used with aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.) to perform calculations on each group of data.

#### Syntax of `GROUP BY`:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

- **`column1`, `column2`**: Columns you want to group by.
- **`aggregate_function(column3)`**: An aggregate function (e.g., `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.) applied to the column you want to aggregate.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups the results based on the unique combinations of the specified columns.

#### Example:

Consider the following `sales` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    store_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    sale_date DATE
);
```

This table tracks individual sales transactions, including the product sold, the store that made the sale, and the quantity sold.

To calculate the total sales quantity for each `product_id`, we can use `GROUP BY` to group the results by `product_id`.

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The query groups the data by `product_id`.
  - The `SUM(quantity)` function calculates the total quantity of each product sold.
- **Output**:
  The result might look like this:
  
| product_id | total_sales |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 200         |
| 2          | 150         |
| 3          | 300         |
  
This means product with `product_id = 1` had a total of 200 units sold, and product `2` had 150 units sold.

### 2. **`HAVING` Clause**

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after the `GROUP BY` operation. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is applied **after** the grouping and aggregation has been performed. The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the results based on the aggregated data, while the `WHERE` clause filters rows before any aggregation.

#### Syntax of `HAVING`:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING aggregate_function(column3) condition;
```

- **`HAVING`**: Filters the groups based on the aggregated values.

#### Example:

Let's extend the previous example and say we only want to see products that have sold more than 200 units.

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 200;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The query groups the data by `product_id` and calculates the total sales for each product.
  - The `HAVING` clause filters the groups where the total quantity sold is greater than 200.
- **Output**:
  
| product_id | total_sales |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 200         |
| 3          | 300         |
  
Only products with a total sale greater than 200 units will be included in the result set. In this case, product 3 had 300 units sold, and product 1 had 200 units, so both are included in the result.

### 3. **Combining `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`**

The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are often used together in SQL. First, you group data by specific columns, then you filter the groups based on conditions applied to the aggregated data.

#### Scenario:

Imagine you have an `orders` table that looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    order_date DATE
);
```

The table tracks orders, including the `customer_id`, `order_amount`, and `order_date` of each order.

You want to find customers who have made more than 2 orders and whose total order amount exceeds $1000.

#### Query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS order_count, SUM(order_amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 2 AND SUM(order_amount) > 1000;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The query groups the data by `customer_id` to calculate the total number of orders (`COUNT(order_id)`) and the total amount spent (`SUM(order_amount)`).
  - The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only show customers who have made more than 2 orders and have a total order amount greater than $1000.
  
- **Output**:

| customer_id | order_count | total_amount |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 101         | 3           | 1500.00      |
| 102         | 5           | 2200.00      |

This shows that customer `101` made 3 orders with a total amount of $1500, and customer `102` made 5 orders with a total amount of $2200.

### Key Points:

- **`GROUP BY`**:
  - Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.
  - It is used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.) to aggregate data.
  - `GROUP BY` happens **before** filtering in the query.
  
- **`HAVING`**:
  - Filters the result of the `GROUP BY` operation.
  - It is used **after** the aggregation has been performed, unlike `WHERE` which is used to filter rows before grouping.
  - It works with aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.).

### Examples with Output Details

#### Example 1: Calculate the total amount spent by each customer and filter those with total spending greater than $500.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(order_amount) > 500;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The query groups the data by `customer_id` and sums the `order_amount` for each customer.
  - The `HAVING` clause filters the groups where the total spending is greater than $500.
- **Output**:

| customer_id | total_spent |
|-------------|-------------|
| 101         | 600.00      |
| 102         | 1200.00     |

In this case, customers `101` and `102` spent more than $500, so their data is included in the result.

#### Example 2: Count the number of orders for each customer and show only customers with more than 3 orders.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 3;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The query counts the number of orders for each customer.
  - The `HAVING` clause filters the customers who have more than 3 orders.
- **Output**:

| customer_id | order_count |
|-------------|-------------|
| 102         | 5           |
| 105         | 4           |

Only customers with more than 3 orders are included in the result.

### Summary of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`:

1. **`GROUP BY`**: 
   - Groups rows by the values in specified columns.
   - Used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on grouped data.
   - Filters rows **before** grouping.
   
2. **`HAVING`**: 
   - Filters the result after grouping and aggregation.
   - Can be used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.).
   - Filters groups **after** the `GROUP BY` operation.

These clauses help you perform more complex queries and allow you to analyze data efficiently by grouping and filtering based on aggregates.
