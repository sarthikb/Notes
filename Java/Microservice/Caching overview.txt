Caching is a critical performance and scalability strategy in microservice architecture. It helps reduce latency, decrease load on services and databases, and improve overall system responsiveness.

## ‚úÖ Why Cache in Microservices?

In microservices, services often communicate over the network and may share databases. Without caching:

* Every request may result in **expensive database calls**
* Services may be **overloaded with repetitive queries**
* Inter-service latency increases

## üöÄ Common Caching Techniques in Microservice Architecture

| Technique                                 | Scope                       | Used For                             | Example                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1. **In-Memory Cache**                    | Per service                 | Fast, local data                     | Spring Cache with `@Cacheable` |
| 2. **Distributed Cache**                  | Shared across services      | Scalability, shared state            | Redis, Memcached               |
| 3. **HTTP/Response Caching**              | Client or API gateway       | Caching full HTTP responses          | CDN, reverse proxy             |
| 4. **Database Query Caching**             | DB level                    | Avoid re-executing expensive queries | MySQL query cache              |
| 5. **Application-Level Object Cache**     | Service layer               | Caching specific objects             | Guava, Caffeine                |
| 6. **Write-Through / Write-Behind Cache** | Data consistency strategies | Data stored in cache and DB          | Redis, Hazelcast               |
| 7. **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**         | Read-heavy apps             | Fetch from DB if not in cache        | Manual or Spring abstraction   |

## üß± 1. In-Memory Cache (Local Cache)

* Resides within each service instance
* Fastest access (no network hop)
* Good for non-changing data (e.g., config, enums)

üîß Example:

```java
@Cacheable("products")
public Product getProductById(String id) {
    return productRepository.findById(id);
}
```

üìå Tools:

* Spring Boot Cache (`@Cacheable`)
* Caffeine
* Guava

---

## üß± 2. Distributed Cache

* Shared across instances or services
* Consistent and scalable

üìå Tools:

* **Redis**
* **Hazelcast**
* **Memcached**

üß© Example use case:

* Authentication tokens
* Session storage
* Rate-limiting keys
* Frequently used lookup tables

---

## üß± 3. HTTP/Response Cache

* Stores complete HTTP responses at client/browser/CDN/API Gateway
* Based on headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, etc.

üõ† Examples:

* NGINX reverse proxy
* Cloudflare CDN
* Spring Cloud Gateway caching

üß© Good for:

* Static resources
* Product listings
* Frequently accessed but infrequently changed data

---

## üß± 4. Cache-Aside Pattern (Lazy Loading)

> "Read-through" cache ‚Äì app checks cache first, falls back to DB on miss.

**Steps:**

1. Check cache
2. If miss, fetch from DB and populate cache
3. On update, write to DB and invalidate cache

üß© Example:

```java
public Product getProduct(String id) {
    Product cached = redis.get(id);
    if (cached != null) return cached;

    Product dbProduct = db.find(id);
    redis.set(id, dbProduct);
    return dbProduct;
}
```

üìå Best for:

* Read-heavy systems
* When stale data is acceptable for a short time

---

## üß± 5. Write-Through Cache

> Every write goes **first to the cache**, which then writes to the DB.

* Ensures cache is always up to date
* Slightly slower writes due to double-write

üß© Best for:

* Systems where reads far outnumber writes
* Low-latency requirements for reads

---

## üß± 6. Write-Behind (Write-Back) Cache

> Write to cache, and **defer DB write** asynchronously.

* Faster writes
* Risk of data loss if cache fails before flushing

üìå Needs:

* Persistent/replicated cache (e.g., Redis AOF)
* Flush mechanism

---

## üß± 7. Expiring / TTL Cache

* Each cache entry has a TTL (time to live)
* Useful for ensuring **eventual freshness**

üß© Example:

* Redis `SET key value EX 60` (expire in 60s)

---

## üß± 8. Client-Side Cache

* Browsers or frontend apps cache GET responses
* Controlled via headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`)

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**                | Cache responses to reduce calls to internal services    |
| **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** | Cache data per frontend to improve UX                   |
| **CQRS**                       | Cache read models for faster queries                    |
| **SAGA / Event Sourcing**      | Cache frequently accessed projections or events         |
| **Database per service**       | Cache joins or denormalized views across DBs            |
| **Service Mesh**               | Some support built-in distributed caching (e.g., Envoy) |

| High-performance, low-latency reads  | In-memory + distributed cache         |
| Shared session/state across services | Distributed (Redis)                   |
| Dynamic content, frequent updates    | Cache-aside with TTL                  |
| Rare updates, static content         | Write-through / HTTP caching          |
| Read-heavy analytics                 | CQRS read-side + cache                |
