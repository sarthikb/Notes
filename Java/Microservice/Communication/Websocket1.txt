You're now looking at a **STOMP `CONNECT` frame**, which is the very first step a **STOMP-over-WebSocket client** takes to initiate communication with the server. Let me explain what this means and why it's important in your real-time WebSocket setup.

---

## 🔍 Frame Details Breakdown

```json
{
  "command": "CONNECT",
  "headers": {
    "heart-beat": "25000,25000",
    "accept-version": "1.2,1.1,1.0"
  },
  "body": ""
}
```

---

## 🧠 What is This?

This is a **STOMP frame** sent **from the client to the server** when a new connection is being established over WebSocket.

## 🧾 Field-by-Field Explanation

| Field                         | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **command: "CONNECT"**        | STOMP command indicating the client wants to establish a session.                                            |
| **accept-version**            | The versions of the STOMP protocol the client supports. The server will select the most appropriate version. |
| **heart-beat: "25000,25000"** | Heartbeat settings: client wants to send a ping every 25 seconds, and expects the server to do the same.     |
| **body: ""**                  | The `CONNECT` frame has no body — it's just for session negotiation.                                         |

## 🔄 Connection Lifecycle with STOMP

```text
Client          Server
  |               |
  | --- CONNECT -->|   (Client initiates)
  |               |
  | <-- CONNECTED --|  (Server acknowledges + heartbeat settings)
  |               |
  | --- SUBSCRIBE -->|  (Client subscribes to a topic)
  |               |
  | <-- MESSAGE -----|  (Server sends messages to topic)
```

---

## 🔌 Why Is `heart-beat` Important?

It ensures the **connection stays alive**, even if there's no real data traffic.

* `"25000,25000"` means:

  * Client will send a heartbeat **every 25 seconds**
  * Client expects to receive a heartbeat from server **every 25 seconds**
* This helps detect **dead connections** (e.g., if the user loses internet).

## 🏁 Summary

| Component        | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CONNECT` Frame  | Initiates STOMP session from client to server |
| `accept-version` | Lets server choose STOMP protocol version     |
| `heart-beat`     | Keeps connection alive and monitored          |
| Empty `body`     | Normal — not needed for CONNECT               |

---

## ✅ After This CONNECT Frame

If the connection is successful, the server replies with a **`CONNECTED` frame**, like this:

```json
{
  "command": "CONNECTED",
  "headers": {
    "version": "1.2",
    "heart-beat": "0,0"
  }
}
```

Then, the client can:

* **Subscribe** to topics
* **Send messages**
* **Receive real-time events**

Let me know if you'd like:

* To **customize heartbeats** for high-availability systems
* Add **authentication headers** in the `CONNECT` frame
* Handle **reconnection logic** on the frontend or backend
