### Semaphore in Java

A **Semaphore** is a synchronization mechanism that controls access to a shared resource by maintaining a set of permits. A **semaphore** is initialized with a certain number of permits, and each thread that wants to access the shared resource must acquire a permit. If no permits are available, the thread is blocked until a permit becomes available.

Semaphores are useful when you want to limit the number of threads that can access a particular resource or perform a specific task concurrently.

In Java, **`Semaphore`** is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and can be used for this purpose. It works as a counter that manages permits. The **acquire()** method decreases the permit count and blocks the thread if no permits are available. The **release()** method increases the permit count, potentially allowing a waiting thread to proceed.

### Key Characteristics of Semaphore:
- **Permits**: The number of available permits determines how many threads can acquire the semaphore concurrently.
- **Blocking/Non-blocking**: When no permits are available, threads can either block until a permit is released (blocking behavior) or attempt to acquire a permit within a specified time (non-blocking behavior).
- **Fairness**: You can configure a semaphore to ensure **fairness**, meaning that the threads acquire the semaphore in the order they requested it. This is done by passing `true` to the constructor of `Semaphore`.

### Key Methods:
- **`acquire()`**: Acquires a permit from the semaphore. If no permit is available, the thread is blocked until a permit is released.
- **`release()`**: Releases a permit, making it available for other threads to acquire.
- **`availablePermits()`**: Returns the number of available permits at the time of the call.
- **`tryAcquire()`**: Tries to acquire a permit, but does not block. It returns `true` if a permit was successfully acquired, otherwise `false`.
- **`acquireUninterruptibly()`**: Acquires a permit without being interrupted (i.e., it does not throw `InterruptedException`).

### Example of Semaphore Usage

Let's demonstrate a basic example where a limited number of threads can access a shared resource simultaneously.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

class SharedResource {
    private final Semaphore semaphore;

    public SharedResource(int maxThreads) {
        // Semaphore initialized with 'maxThreads' number of permits
        semaphore = new Semaphore(maxThreads, true); // 'true' ensures fair ordering of threads
    }

    public void accessResource(int threadId) {
        try {
            // Acquire a permit to access the resource
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " attempting to acquire a permit...");
            semaphore.acquire();
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " has acquired a permit!");

            // Simulate resource access
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " is accessing the resource.");
            Thread.sleep(2000);  // Simulate some processing time

            // Release the permit after using the resource
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " is releasing the permit.");
            semaphore.release();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadId + " was interrupted.");
        }
    }
}

public class SemaphoreExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource(3);  // Only 3 threads can access at the same time

        // Create and start 5 threads that will try to access the shared resource
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int threadId = i;
            new Thread(() -> resource.accessResource(threadId)).start();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **SharedResource Class**: This class simulates a shared resource with a **`Semaphore`** that allows only a limited number of threads to access it concurrently. The semaphore is initialized with `maxThreads`, which determines how many threads can access the resource simultaneously.

   - **`accessResource(int threadId)`**: This method simulates the action of accessing the resource. It first acquires a permit from the semaphore, performs some processing (simulated by `Thread.sleep()`), and then releases the permit once done.

2. **Semaphore Initialization**: The semaphore is initialized with a maximum number of permits (`maxThreads`). This determines how many threads can simultaneously access the resource. In this example, itâ€™s set to `3`, meaning that only 3 threads can access the shared resource at any given time.

3. **Main Method**: We create 5 threads, and each thread will attempt to acquire a permit to access the shared resource. Since there are only 3 permits, only 3 threads can access the resource at the same time, and the remaining threads will have to wait.

### Expected Output:

```
Thread 1 attempting to acquire a permit...
Thread 1 has acquired a permit!
Thread 1 is accessing the resource.
Thread 2 attempting to acquire a permit...
Thread 2 has acquired a permit!
Thread 2 is accessing the resource.
Thread 3 attempting to acquire a permit...
Thread 3 has acquired a permit!
Thread 3 is accessing the resource.
Thread 4 attempting to acquire a permit...
Thread 5 attempting to acquire a permit...
Thread 1 is releasing the permit.
Thread 4 has acquired a permit!
Thread 4 is accessing the resource.
Thread 2 is releasing the permit.
Thread 5 has acquired a permit!
Thread 5 is accessing the resource.
...
```

### Key Points:
- **Semaphore Initialization**: The `Semaphore` is initialized with a specific number of permits, which controls how many threads can access the resource at the same time.
- **Concurrency Control**: By using the semaphore, we can control how many threads can access the shared resource concurrently, helping avoid overloading the resource or ensuring that only a specific number of threads are allowed to proceed.
- **Fairness**: The constructor `new Semaphore(3, true)` ensures that threads acquire the semaphore in a fair manner (FIFO order). If `false` were passed, the threads could acquire the semaphore in an arbitrary order.

### Use Cases for Semaphore:
1. **Limiting Concurrent Access**: Semaphore is ideal when you have a limited resource (e.g., a pool of database connections, limited hardware resources) and you want to control how many threads can access it concurrently.
2. **Traffic Control**: It can be used in situations where you want to manage traffic to a specific section, such as limiting the number of threads accessing a shared network resource.
3. **Thread Pool Management**: Semaphores are often used to control the number of threads accessing a set of resources, such as a fixed-size thread pool.

### Summary:
- **Semaphore** allows you to control access to a shared resource by using a fixed number of permits.
- **acquire()** blocks the thread if no permits are available, and **release()** makes a permit available for other threads.
- You can configure fairness in a semaphore to ensure threads acquire permits in a fair, FIFO order.
- It's useful for managing limited resources and controlling concurrency.
