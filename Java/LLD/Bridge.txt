Absolutely! Let's now explore the **Bridge Design Pattern** â€” a **structural pattern** that is sometimes confused with Adapter but serves a different purpose.

---

## ðŸ§  What Is the Bridge Pattern?

The **Bridge Pattern** decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

---

### âœ… When to Use Bridge Pattern

* You want to avoid a **combinatorial explosion** of classes.
* You have multiple **dimensions of variation** (e.g., shape type and drawing API).
* You want to keep **abstraction and implementation separate** for better flexibility and maintainability.

---

## ðŸ”Œ Real-World Analogy: Remote Control and Devices

Imagine a **Remote Control** as an abstraction. It can turn on/off any **Device** like a **TV** or **Radio**. Different brands or types of devices can still be controlled with the same remote interface, but each device might work differently.

---

## âœ… Objective

Weâ€™ll model:

* A `RemoteControl` (abstraction)
* Devices like `TV`, `Radio` (implementations)
* `AdvancedRemote` (extended abstraction)

                                  +-----------+ +--------+
```

## âœ… Java Implementation

### 1. Implementor Interface: `Device`

```java
public interface Device {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
    void setVolume(int percent);
}
```

---

### 2. Concrete Implementors: `TV`, `Radio`

```java
public class TV implements Device {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("TV is ON");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("TV is OFF");
    }

    @Override
    public void setVolume(int percent) {
        System.out.println("TV volume set to " + percent + "%");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Radio implements Device {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Radio is ON");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Radio is OFF");
    }

    @Override
    public void setVolume(int percent) {
        System.out.println("Radio volume set to " + percent + "%");
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Abstraction: `RemoteControl`

```java
public class RemoteControl {
    protected Device device;

    public RemoteControl(Device device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void turnOn() {
        device.turnOn();
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        device.turnOff();
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Refined Abstraction: `AdvancedRemote`

```java
public class AdvancedRemote extends RemoteControl {

    public AdvancedRemote(Device device) {
        super(device);
    }

    public void mute() {
        System.out.println("Muting the device...");
        device.setVolume(0);
    }
}
```

---

### 5. Client Code: Test the Bridge

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Device tv = new TV();
        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl(tv);

        remote.turnOn();
        remote.turnOff();

        System.out.println("-----");

        Device radio = new Radio();
        AdvancedRemote advancedRemote = new AdvancedRemote(radio);

        advancedRemote.turnOn();
        advancedRemote.mute();
        advancedRemote.turnOff();
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ§¾ Output

```
TV is ON
TV is OFF
-----
Radio is ON
Muting the device...
Radio volume set to 0%
Radio is OFF
```

## âœ… Key Advantages of Bridge Pattern

| Concept               | In Example                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Abstraction           | `RemoteControl`                                      |
| Refined Abstraction   | `AdvancedRemote`                                     |
| Implementor           | `Device` interface                                   |
| Concrete Implementors | `TV`, `Radio`                                        |
| Decoupled Interfaces  | `RemoteControl` is independent of `TV`/`Radio` logic |

## âœ… Summary

* The **Adapter pattern** helps two incompatible interfaces work together.
* The **Bridge pattern** helps you split abstraction from implementation to avoid class explosion.
* Bridge is especially useful when you expect to scale both dimensions (e.g., multiple remotes and multiple devices).
