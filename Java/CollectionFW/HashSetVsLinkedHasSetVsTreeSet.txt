Certainly! Let's explore the differences between `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, and `TreeSet` in Java, along with examples and details about each.

### 1. **HashSet**
`HashSet` is the most commonly used implementation of the `Set` interface. It stores unique elements and is backed by a **hash table**. It does not maintain any specific order of the elements.

#### Key Features:
- **No order guarantee**: The elements are unordered, meaning their order is not preserved.
- **Allows one null element**: You can store `null` in a `HashSet` (but only one `null`).
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Insertion: **O(1)** (on average)
  - Lookup: **O(1)** (on average)
  - Deletion: **O(1)** (on average)

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements to HashSet
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Orange");
        set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + set);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
HashSet: [Banana, Orange, Apple]
```

Here, the elements in `HashSet` are not in any specific order, and duplicates are automatically ignored.

### 2. **LinkedHashSet**
`LinkedHashSet` is a subclass of `HashSet` that preserves the **insertion order** of elements. It maintains a **linked list** of the elements, which allows it to keep track of the order in which the elements were added.

#### Key Features:
- **Order maintained**: Elements are stored in the order they were added (insertion order).
- **No duplicates**: Like `HashSet`, it does not allow duplicate elements.
- **Allows one null element**: Like `HashSet`, it can store only one `null`.
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Insertion: **O(1)** (on average)
  - Lookup: **O(1)** (on average)
  - Deletion: **O(1)** (on average)

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

public class LinkedHashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedHashSet<String> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements to LinkedHashSet
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Orange");
        set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        
        System.out.println("LinkedHashSet: " + set);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
LinkedHashSet: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
```

Here, the order of insertion is preserved. The duplicate "Apple" is ignored, and the set maintains the order of elements as they were added.

### 3. **TreeSet**
`TreeSet` is an implementation of the `Set` interface that is backed by a **Red-Black tree** (a type of self-balancing binary search tree). It stores elements in a **sorted order** according to their natural ordering or by a custom comparator.

#### Key Features:
- **Sorted order**: The elements are stored in ascending order by default (natural ordering), or according to a `Comparator` if provided.
- **No duplicates**: Like `HashSet`, it does not allow duplicates.
- **Does not allow `null`**: You cannot store `null` in a `TreeSet` because it requires a natural ordering or a `Comparator`, and `null` cannot be compared.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insertion: **O(log n)**
  - Lookup: **O(log n)**
  - Deletion: **O(log n)**

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements to TreeSet
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Orange");
        set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        
        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + set);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
TreeSet: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
```

In `TreeSet`, the elements are stored in a **sorted order** (alphabetically for `String`s). Duplicate elements are not added.

#### Example with Custom Comparator:
You can also use a custom comparator to control the sorting order. For instance, let's sort the elements in **reverse order**:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TreeSetWithComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Adding elements to TreeSet
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Orange");
        set.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        
        System.out.println("TreeSet (Reverse Order): " + set);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
TreeSet (Reverse Order): [Orange, Banana, Apple]
```

Here, the elements are sorted in **reverse alphabetical order**.

### **Comparison Table:**

| Feature               | **HashSet**                              | **LinkedHashSet**                         | **TreeSet**                               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Ordering**          | No specific order (unordered)           | Maintains insertion order                 | Stores elements in **sorted order**       |
| **Duplicates**        | No duplicates allowed                    | No duplicates allowed                     | No duplicates allowed                     |
| **Null values**       | Allows one `null` element                | Allows one `null` element                 | **Does not allow `null` values**          |
| **Performance**       | Fast insertion, lookup, and removal (O(1)) | Similar to `HashSet` (O(1))               | Slower insertion and lookup (O(log n))    |
| **Internal Data Structure** | Hash table (uses hashing)          | Hash table with linked list (uses hashing and maintains order) | Red-Black tree (sorted order)             |
| **Use Cases**         | Use when insertion order doesn't matter | Use when insertion order is important     | Use when you need sorted data or natural ordering |

### **When to Use Each:**
- **Use `HashSet`**:
  - When you need a **fast set** that doesnâ€™t require ordering.
  - For **unique** elements with no concern for order.
  - When performance is crucial (insertion, removal, and lookup).
  
- **Use `LinkedHashSet`**:
  - When you need a **set that maintains insertion order**.
  - When you want **fast access** like a `HashSet`, but also need to preserve the order in which elements are added.

- **Use `TreeSet`**:
  - When you need the elements to be stored in **sorted order**.
  - When you need **range queries** or **ordered traversal** (e.g., getting the smallest or largest elements).
  - When you want to use a **custom comparator** to control the order of elements.

---

In conclusion:
- **`HashSet`** is the most efficient for general use when you don't care about order.
- **`LinkedHashSet`** is useful when order of insertion matters.
- **`TreeSet`** is ideal when you need elements sorted in a natural order or using a custom comparator.
