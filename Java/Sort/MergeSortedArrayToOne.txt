To merge two sorted arrays in Java, where the first array (`A`) has enough space to accommodate both arrays and contains `m` valid elements followed by `n` empty slots, and the second array (`B`) contains `n` valid elements, we can use a two-pointer technique. The idea is to start from the end of both arrays and fill in `A` from the back to the front, which helps avoid overwriting elements in `A`.

### Java Implementation

Here's how you can implement this:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MergeSortedArrays {

    public static void merge(int[] A, int m, int[] B, int n) {
        // Last index of A
        int i = m - 1;
        // Last index of B
        int j = n - 1;
        // Last index of merged array
        int k = m + n - 1;

        // Merge in reverse order
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (A[i] > B[j]) {
                A[k] = A[i];
                i--;
            } else {
                A[k] = B[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }

        // If there are remaining elements in B
        while (j >= 0) {
            A[k] = B[j];
            j--;
            k--;
        }

        // No need to copy remaining elements of A, they are already in place
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] A = new int[8]; // Array A with enough space (m+n)
        A[0] = 1;
        A[1] = 3;
        A[2] = 5;
        A[3] = 7;
        // Remaining spaces will be filled during the merge
        int m = 4; // Number of elements in A
        
        int[] B = {2, 4, 6}; // Array B
        int n = B.length; // Number of elements in B

        merge(A, m, B, n);
        
        System.out.println("Merged Array: " + Arrays.toString(A));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` points to the last valid element in `A`.
   - `j` points to the last valid element in `B`.
   - `k` points to the last index of the merged array in `A`.

2. **Merging**:
   - We compare the elements pointed to by `i` and `j`.
   - The larger element is placed at index `k` in `A`, and we move the pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`) accordingly.
   - This continues until we have processed all elements from either `A` or `B`.

3. **Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are remaining elements in `B`, we copy them over to `A`.
   - No action is needed for remaining elements in `A` because they are already in their correct position.

4. **Main Method**:
   - Initializes the arrays `A` and `B`, calls the `merge` method, and prints the resulting merged array.

### Output

After executing the program, the output will be:

```
Merged Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0]
```

This demonstrates how to merge two sorted arrays efficiently without requiring additional space.
