In Spring Boot, `@Component` and `@Configuration` are both used to define beans, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here’s a detailed comparison along with examples:

### 1. **@Component**

- **Purpose**: The `@Component` annotation is a general-purpose stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It indicates that the class is a Spring bean and should be registered in the application context.

- **Usage**: Typically used for classes that represent a service, repository, or any other component in the application.

- **Lifecycle**: Beans defined with `@Component` are instantiated, managed, and destroyed by the Spring container like any other Spring bean.

- **Examples of Specialized Stereotypes**:
  - `@Service`: For service layer classes.
  - `@Repository`: For data access layer classes.
  - `@Controller`: For Spring MVC controllers.

**Example**:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyService {
    public void performAction() {
        System.out.println("Action performed!");
    }
}
```

### 2. **@Configuration**

- **Purpose**: The `@Configuration` annotation indicates that a class contains one or more `@Bean` methods. It is used to define a source of bean definitions, allowing you to create and configure beans explicitly.

- **Usage**: Typically used for classes that provide bean definitions that require customization or when you want to create beans programmatically.

- **Lifecycle**: The beans defined in `@Configuration` classes are singletons by default, meaning that only one instance of each bean is created and shared across the application.

- **Example of Bean Definition**:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService(); // Custom instantiation or configuration can go here
    }
}
```

### Key Differences

| Feature                | @Component                          | @Configuration                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | General-purpose bean definition     | Specific source of bean definitions  |
| **Bean Method**        | Automatically detects beans         | Defines beans using `@Bean` methods  |
| **Instantiation**      | Created directly by Spring          | Provides a method for bean creation   |
| **Lifecycle**          | Each instance can be a new instance | Beans are singleton by default       |
| **Usage Context**      | Any Spring-managed component        | Configuration classes for beans      |

### Example Usage Together

You can use both annotations together in a Spring Boot application. Here’s an example that illustrates their combined usage:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
        MyService myService = context.getBean(MyService.class);
        myService.performAction();
    }
}

@Component
class MyService {
    public void performAction() {
        System.out.println("Action performed!");
    }
}

@Configuration
class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myCustomService() {
        return new MyService() {
            @Override
            public void performAction() {
                System.out.println("Custom action performed!");
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

- Use `@Component` for generic components and beans.
- Use `@Configuration` when you need to explicitly define bean methods and their configurations.
- Both annotations help manage dependencies and provide a way for Spring to instantiate and configure beans, but they do so in different contexts and for different purposes.
