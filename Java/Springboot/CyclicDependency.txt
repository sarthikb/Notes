Cyclic dependency occurs when two or more beans in a Spring application depend on each other, creating a circular reference. 
This situation can lead to problems during bean initialization, as Spring's IoC container cannot resolve the dependencies.

### How Cyclic Dependency Works

In Spring, cyclic dependencies can manifest in two primary forms:

1. **Constructor-based cyclic dependency**: Both beans declare their dependencies through constructors.
2. **Setter-based cyclic dependency**: Beans reference each other via setter methods.

### Example of Cyclic Dependency

Let's create an example to demonstrate cyclic dependency using both constructor and setter injection.

#### Step 1: Create Two Classes

We'll create two classes, `ClassA` and `ClassB`, where `ClassA` depends on `ClassB`, and `ClassB` depends on `ClassA`.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

// Class A
@Component
public class ClassA {
    private final ClassB classB;

    @Autowired
    public ClassA(ClassB classB) {
        this.classB = classB;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("ClassA is doing something and calling ClassB...");
        classB.doSomethingElse();
    }
}

// Class B
@Component
public class ClassB {
    private final ClassA classA;

    @Autowired
    public ClassB(ClassA classA) {
        this.classA = classA;
    }

    public void doSomethingElse() {
        System.out.println("ClassB is doing something else and calling ClassA...");
        classA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Main Application Class

Now, create a main application class to run the Spring Boot application.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);

        // Get ClassA bean and trigger method to demonstrate cyclic dependency
        ClassA classA = context.getBean(ClassA.class);
        classA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Expected Behavior

When you run this application, you will encounter a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` indicating that the Spring container cannot create a bean because it is already in creation, leading to a cyclic dependency.

### Resolving Cyclic Dependency

1. **Use Setter Injection**: One way to resolve cyclic dependencies is to use setter injection instead of constructor injection. This allows Spring to create the beans first and inject dependencies later.

**Revised Example Using Setter Injection**:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

// Class A
@Component
public class ClassA {
    private ClassB classB;

    @Autowired
    public void setClassB(ClassB classB) {
        this.classB = classB;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("ClassA is doing something and calling ClassB...");
        classB.doSomethingElse();
    }
}

// Class B
@Component
public class ClassB {
    private ClassA classA;

    @Autowired
    public void setClassA(ClassA classA) {
        this.classA = classA;
    }

    public void doSomethingElse() {
        System.out.println("ClassB is doing something else and calling ClassA...");
        classA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Test the Application Again

Now, run the application again with the revised code. You should see the following output without any exceptions:

```
ClassA is doing something and calling ClassB...
ClassB is doing something else and calling ClassA...
ClassA is doing something and calling ClassB...
...
```

### Conclusion

Cyclic dependencies can lead to issues during bean initialization in Spring. 
Using setter injection is one common way to resolve these cyclic references. 
However, itâ€™s generally advisable to avoid cyclic dependencies altogether by rethinking the design of your classes. 
Strategies such as introducing a third component to manage interactions or using event-driven architecture can help mitigate cyclic dependencies and promote cleaner code structure.
