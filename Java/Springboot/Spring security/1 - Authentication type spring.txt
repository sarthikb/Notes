Great question! In **Spring Security** (and in web development in general), there are several **types of authentication mechanisms** you can use depending on the use case — from basic systems to enterprise-level security.

Let’s explore the most common ones:

---

## 🔐 Common Types of Authentication

### 1. **HTTP Basic Authentication**

* ✅ What you’ve already used.
* 🔑 Sends username and password in the `Authorization` header.
* 😬 Only safe over HTTPS.
* ✅ Simple, good for internal APIs and testing.

---

### 2. **Form-Based Authentication**

* 🧑‍💻 Used in traditional web applications (login forms).
* 🖼️ User submits a username and password via a form (HTML).
* 🔐 Spring Security handles login, session creation, and redirection.

✅ Example:

```java
http
    .formLogin() // Enables login form
    .defaultSuccessUrl("/home", true)
    .permitAll();
```

---

### 3. **Token-Based Authentication (JWT)**

* 🔥 Very common in REST APIs and SPAs.
* ✅ Stateless (no sessions).
* 👤 Server generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) after login.
* 📦 Token is stored on client-side (usually in `localStorage` or cookies).
* 📨 Sent in `Authorization` header like:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
  ```

✅ Example:

* Login → Server returns JWT → Client stores it → Sends it in every request.

---

### 4. **Session-Based Authentication**

* 💾 Server maintains a session after login.
* 🧠 Server keeps user state in memory or a database.
* 🧼 Uses cookies (usually `JSESSIONID`) to track sessions.
* Common in traditional web apps (Spring MVC + Thymeleaf).

---

### 5. **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**

* 🌍 Used for 3rd-party login (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
* 🙌 Delegates authentication to external providers.
* 🔐 More secure and feature-rich.
* Spring Security has full support for OAuth2.

✅ Example:

```java
http
    .oauth2Login(); // Enables Google/Facebook login
```

🔗 Used in enterprise SSO, social logins, and mobile apps.

### 6. **LDAP Authentication**

* 🏢 Common in corporate environments.
* 🔍 Authenticates users via LDAP directories like Active Directory.
* 🔐 Spring Security can connect to LDAP servers.

✅ Use case: Large companies managing users centrally.

---

### 7. **API Key Authentication**

* 🗝️ A fixed token (API key) sent with each request.
* Often used in internal APIs, IoT devices, or external services.
* Sent as a header or query param:

  ```
  X-API-KEY: abc123
  ```

🛡️ Not secure unless used with HTTPS and key rotation.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Auth Type     | Best For                     | Stateless | Security Level | Notes                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Basic Auth    | Internal APIs, testing       | ✅         | Low/Medium     | Use with HTTPS only               |
| Form Login    | Traditional web apps         | ❌         | Medium         | Uses sessions & cookies           |
| JWT           | REST APIs, SPAs, mobile apps | ✅         | High           | No server state, token in headers |
| Session Auth  | Web apps (Spring MVC)        | ❌         | Medium         | Requires server-side session mgmt |
| OAuth2 / OIDC | Social login, enterprise SSO | ✅/❌       | Very High      | Best for delegating auth          |
| LDAP          | Corporate apps               | ❌         | High           | Auth from centralized user store  |
| API Key       | Internal APIs, 3rd party     | ✅         | Medium         | Simpler than JWT, but less secure |
