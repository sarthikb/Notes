OAuth 2.0 defines **four primary grant types** (aka flows), each suited to different scenarios. These grant types specify how a client obtains an **access token** from the **authorization server** to access resources on behalf of the **resource owner**.

---

## 🔑 1. **Authorization Code Grant (with PKCE)**

### ✅ Use Case: **Web apps, SPAs, and mobile apps** (most secure)

Used when the client can’t be fully trusted to keep secrets (e.g., in mobile or browser apps).

### 🔄 Workflow:

1. **Client redirects user** to Authorization Server with:

   * `response_type=code`
   * `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, and **PKCE challenge**
2. **User logs in** and grants access.
3. **Authorization Server** redirects back with an **authorization code**.
4. Client sends:

   * `client_id`, `code`, `redirect_uri`, and **PKCE verifier**
5. **Authorization Server** responds with:

   * `access_token` (and optional `refresh_token`)
6. Client uses `access_token` to call the Resource Server.

### 🔒 PKCE: Adds extra protection by preventing code interception.

### ✅ When to use:

* **Web or mobile apps** where users authenticate via browser
* Highly recommended for **public clients** (i.e., no client secret)

## 🧾 2. **Client Credentials Grant**

### ✅ Use Case: **Machine-to-machine (M2M)** communication

Used when a backend service needs to authenticate **itself** (no user involved).

### 🔄 Workflow:

1. Client (a server) sends request to Authorization Server with:

   * `grant_type=client_credentials`
   * `client_id`, `client_secret`
2. **Authorization Server** validates the client and issues:

   * `access_token`
3. Client uses token to call the Resource Server.

### ✅ When to use:

* Cron jobs
* API-to-API communication
* Microservices within your infrastructure

## 👤 3. **Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant** (DEPRECATED / NOT RECOMMENDED)

### ❌ Use Case: Only for trusted apps under strict control

User provides username and password directly to the client (riskier approach).

### 🔄 Workflow:

1. Client collects:

   * `username` + `password` + `client_id` + `client_secret`
2. Sends them to the Authorization Server
3. Authorization Server issues:

   * `access_token` (and optionally `refresh_token`)
4. Client uses token to access the resource.

### ⚠️ Risks:

* Client handles user credentials directly.
* Not secure for most cases.
* Largely deprecated in favor of other flows (like PKCE).

### ✅ When to use:

* Only when **you fully trust the client**, e.g., first-party apps
* Otherwise, **avoid this grant**

---

## 🔁 4. **Implicit Grant** (LEGACY, NOT RECOMMENDED)

### ❌ Use Case: Formerly used for SPAs (not anymore)

Used to directly return an `access_token` in the browser redirect.

### 🔄 Workflow:

1. Redirect user with:

   * `response_type=token`
2. Authorization Server responds directly with:

   * `access_token` in the URL fragment (`#access_token=...`)
3. Client uses token to access resource.

### ⚠️ Risks:

* Tokens exposed in browser history and logs
* No refresh tokens
* Vulnerable to token leakage

### ✅ When to use:

* Don’t. Replaced by **Authorization Code + PKCE** for SPAs
