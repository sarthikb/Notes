Great question! ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs clarify the relationship between **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT** ‚Äî because while they often work together, they‚Äôre not the same thing.

---

## üîë Short Answer:

> **OAuth 2.0 can use JWTs** as **access tokens**, but it‚Äôs not required to.
> When used together, you get **token-based authentication**, and yes ‚Äî it's **JWT-based authentication** within the OAuth 2.0 framework.

## üìò Detailed Explanation

| Concept          | What It Is                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OAuth 2.0**    | A **framework** for **delegated authorization**. Defines flows like Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc. |
| **JWT**          | A **token format** ‚Äî a compact, self-contained way to transmit claims securely                                   |
| **Access Token** | The actual token OAuth 2.0 issues to access resources ‚Äî can be **JWT**, opaque string, etc.                      |

## üîÑ How They Work Together

When you use **Keycloak**, **Auth0**, or any modern IdP:

* You authenticate via **OAuth 2.0 flow**
* The IdP issues **JWT tokens**

  * `access_token` ‚Üí used to call protected APIs
  * `id_token` ‚Üí contains user identity info (OpenID Connect)
* The **backend API** validates the JWT's signature and claims

‚úÖ This is what most people mean by "JWT authentication" ‚Äî it's part of an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.

## üß† Example (OAuth2 + JWT)

**Authorization Code Flow** with OIDC:

1. User logs in via OAuth2 client (e.g., frontend)
2. Gets:

   * `access_token` (JWT)
   * `id_token` (JWT)
   * `refresh_token` (optional)
3. Frontend sends `access_token` ‚Üí backend API
4. Backend verifies:

   * Signature
   * Expiry
   * Audience/issuer
   * Scopes or roles
5. If valid ‚Üí user is authenticated and authorized

## ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT ‚â† OAuth2

| JWT by itself                         | OAuth 2.0 with JWT                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| You generate/validate tokens manually | Tokens are part of OAuth flow issued by IdP  |
| No standard way to authenticate user  | Defined flows and scopes for login & consent |
| No built-in refresh/expiry handling   | Has refresh tokens, token revocation, scopes |

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **OAuth 2.0 is a protocol** for authorization.
* **JWT is a token format** used *inside* OAuth 2.0 in many modern systems.
* When Keycloak or any IdP issues a **JWT access token**, your backend does **JWT-based authentication** within the **OAuth 2.0 framework**.
