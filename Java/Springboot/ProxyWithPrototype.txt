### Using Proxy Mode with Prototype Scope in Spring

In Spring, when using the prototype scope, a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested. 
However, sometimes you want to control the lifecycle of prototype beans while leveraging the benefits of a singleton bean that acts as a proxy. 
This is where the `proxyMode` comes into play.

**Proxy Mode**: When you define a bean with a scope of prototype, you can use proxy mode to create a proxy that manages the lifecycle of the prototype bean. 
This allows you to inject the prototype bean into singleton-scoped beans without losing the prototype's instantiation behavior.

### How It Works

1. **Proxy Creation**: Instead of injecting the prototype bean directly into a singleton bean, you inject a proxy of the prototype bean.
2. **Lifecycle Management**: The proxy manages the instantiation of the prototype bean, ensuring that a new instance is created each time it is needed while the singleton bean is retained.
3. **Flexibility**: This approach provides a way to maintain the benefits of prototype scope (fresh instances) while working within the constraints of singleton beans.

### Use Case: User-Specific Settings in a Web Application

Imagine you have an application where users can set preferences, and you want each user to have their own settings that persist across multiple requests. 
A prototype bean can be used for the user settings, while a singleton service manages those settings.

#### Step 1: Define the Prototype Bean

**UserSettings.java**:

```java
public class UserSettings {
    private String theme;
    private String language;

    public UserSettings() {
        this.theme = "default";
        this.language = "en";
    }

    public String getTheme() {
        return theme;
    }

    public void setTheme(String theme) {
        this.theme = theme;
    }

    public String getLanguage() {
        return language;
    }

    public void setLanguage(String language) {
        this.language = language;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the Configuration Class

**AppConfig.java**:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    @Scope("prototype")
    public UserSettings userSettings() {
        return new UserSettings();
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Singleton Service with Proxy Mode

**UserSettingsService.java**:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ScopeProxyMode;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
@Scope(value = "singleton", proxyMode = ScopeProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class UserSettingsService {

    private final UserSettings userSettings;

    @Autowired
    public UserSettingsService(UserSettings userSettings) {
        this.userSettings = userSettings;
    }

    public UserSettings getUserSettings() {
        return userSettings;
    }

    public void updateSettings(String theme, String language) {
        userSettings.setTheme(theme);
        userSettings.setLanguage(language);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Controller to Handle User Requests

**SettingsController.java**:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/settings")
public class SettingsController {

    private final UserSettingsService userSettingsService;

    @Autowired
    public SettingsController(UserSettingsService userSettingsService) {
        this.userSettingsService = userSettingsService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public UserSettings getUserSettings() {
        return userSettingsService.getUserSettings();
    }

    @PostMapping("/update")
    public String updateUserSettings(@RequestParam String theme, @RequestParam String language) {
        userSettingsService.updateSettings(theme, language);
        return "User settings updated!";
    }
}
```

### Demonstrating the Use Case

With this setup, when you access the `/settings` endpoint, it uses the prototype-scoped `UserSettings` bean, ensuring that each user session has its own instance.

1. **Updating User Settings**:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/settings/update?theme=dark&language=fr"
```

2. **Retrieving User Settings**:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/settings"
```

### Expected Output

For the update request, you will receive:

```
User settings updated!
```

For the retrieval request, you will see:

```
{"theme":"dark","language":"fr"}
```

### Summary

**Benefits of Using Proxy Mode with Prototype Scope**:
- **Lifecycle Management**: Ensures that the prototype bean is instantiated correctly even when injected into singleton beans.
- **Isolation of State**: Each request or user gets a new instance of the prototype bean, which is crucial for user-specific data.
- **Flexibility in Design**: Allows you to combine the benefits of singleton and prototype scopes seamlessly.

**Drawbacks**:
- **Complexity**: Using proxies can add a layer of complexity to the design, as you must understand how Spring manages proxies and scopes.
- **Performance Overhead**: There might be a slight performance impact due to the proxying mechanism, but it is generally negligible compared to the benefits in many use cases.

Using proxy mode with prototype scope effectively supports scenarios where you need user-specific data in a controlled manner while still leveraging the advantages of singleton beans.
