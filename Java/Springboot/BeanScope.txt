In Spring Boot, bean scopes define the lifecycle and visibility of beans within the application context. There are several scopes available, each suited for different use cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the main bean scopes:

### 1. Singleton Scope

- **Definition**: This is the default scope. A single instance of the bean is created and shared throughout the application context.
- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created when the application context is initialized and remains in memory until the application is terminated.
- **Use Case**: Use this scope when you want a single shared instance across multiple components. For example, a service that handles shared business logic.

```java
@Bean
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyService();
}
```

### 2. Prototype Scope

- **Definition**: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the application context.
- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created each time it is requested and is not managed after its creation. It will be eligible for garbage collection when there are no references to it.
- **Use Case**: Use this scope for beans that maintain state and should not be shared. For example, a form object used in a web request.

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
```

### 3. Request Scope

- **Definition**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request. This scope is only valid in a web application.
- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created at the start of an HTTP request and destroyed at the end of the request.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for beans that need to be unique for each HTTP request, like a bean that handles data for a specific user session in a web application.

```java
@Bean
@Scope("request")
public MyRequestScopedBean myRequestScopedBean() {
    return new MyRequestScopedBean();
}
```

### 4. Session Scope

- **Definition**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session. This is also only applicable in a web application.
- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created at the start of an HTTP session and destroyed when the session ends.
- **Use Case**: Useful for storing user-specific data across multiple requests within the same session, like user preferences.

```java
@Bean
@Scope("session")
public MySessionScopedBean mySessionScopedBean() {
    return new MySessionScopedBean();
}
```

### 5. Global Session Scope

- **Definition**: A new instance of the bean is created for each global HTTP session. This is primarily used in portlet applications.
- **Lifecycle**: Similar to session scope but applicable to global sessions in a portlet environment.
- **Use Case**: Not commonly used in standard web applications; more relevant in specific enterprise-level applications involving multiple portlets.

```java
@Bean
@Scope("globalSession")
public MyGlobalSessionScopedBean myGlobalSessionScopedBean() {
    return new MyGlobalSessionScopedBean();
}
```

### 6. Application Scope

- **Definition**: A single instance of the bean is created for the lifecycle of a ServletContext.
- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created when the web application is started and destroyed when the application is shut down.
- **Use Case**: Use this for shared resources that are common across multiple sessions and requests within the same web application.

```java
@Bean
@Scope("application")
public MyApplicationScopedBean myApplicationScopedBean() {
    return new MyApplicationScopedBean();
}
```

### Choosing the Right Scope

When selecting a bean scope, consider:

- **Shared vs. Unique**: Does the bean need to be shared across requests (singleton/application) or unique to each request/session (prototype/request/session)?
- **Statefulness**: Does the bean maintain state that needs to be isolated per user/session?
- **Performance**: Singleton beans are typically more performant since they minimize object creation overhead.

### Conclusion

Understanding bean scopes is crucial for managing the lifecycle of components in a Spring Boot application effectively. 
Each scope serves specific scenarios, and selecting the appropriate one ensures optimal resource management and application performance.
