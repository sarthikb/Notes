The **Database per Service** pattern is a design pattern used in **microservices architecture** where **each microservice has its own dedicated database**. This means that instead of having a single, shared database accessed by all services, each service is responsible for maintaining its own data store. This promotes loose coupling, independent scaling, and autonomy among services.

## üîç Key Concepts of Database per Service Pattern

### 1. **Service Independence**

Each microservice owns and manages its own database schema, data logic, and transactions. This means:

* Changes in one service‚Äôs data model don‚Äôt affect others.
* Services can use the most suitable type of database (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).

### 2. **Encapsulation**

Data is encapsulated within the service boundary, and no other service can access the database directly. Data sharing, if needed, happens through APIs or asynchronous messaging.

### 3. **Autonomy**

A microservice can be developed, deployed, scaled, and managed independently since its data store is not shared.

## üß† Benefits of Database per Service Pattern

| Benefit             | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loose Coupling**  | Services don't depend on a shared schema or shared database, enabling independent evolution. |
| **Scalability**     | Services and their databases can be scaled independently based on demand.                    |
| **Flexibility**     | Each service can choose the database technology best suited to its needs.                    |
| **Fault Isolation** | A failure in one database doesn't necessarily impact other services.                         |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges of Database per Service Pattern

| Challenge                | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Consistency**     | Maintaining consistency across services without shared transactions is difficult (eventual consistency). |
| **Complex Queries**      | Cross-service queries become complex since joins across databases are not possible.                      |
| **Data Duplication**     | Same data might be stored in multiple services for efficiency, leading to duplication.                   |
| **Operational Overhead** | Managing multiple databases increases infrastructure and maintenance overhead.                           |

## üè≠ Real-World Example: E-Commerce Platform

### Scenario: E-commerce platform with the following microservices:

1. **User Service**
2. **Product Service**
3. **Order Service**
4. **Inventory Service**
5. **Payment Service**

---

### Database per Service Architecture:

| Microservice          | Database   | Data                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **User Service**      | PostgreSQL | User profiles, addresses, login credentials |
| **Product Service**   | MongoDB    | Product details, categories, descriptions   |
| **Order Service**     | MySQL      | Orders, order history, status               |
| **Inventory Service** | Redis      | Stock levels, real-time availability        |
| **Payment Service**   | PostgreSQL | Payment records, transaction logs           |

---

### Example Interaction:

A customer places an order:

1. **User Service** authenticates the user.
2. **Product Service** fetches product details.
3. **Inventory Service** checks stock availability.
4. **Order Service** creates an order.
5. **Payment Service** processes payment.

Each service communicates via APIs and manages its data independently. If one service (like Inventory) goes down, others may still function (e.g., user browsing).

## üîÑ Data Sharing Strategies

Since services can't query each other‚Äôs databases directly, they share data using:

### 1. **Synchronous APIs**

* One service calls another via HTTP/gRPC to get the required data.

### 2. **Asynchronous Messaging/Event-Driven Architecture**

* Services publish events (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "PaymentSuccessful").
* Other services subscribe to events and update their own databases accordingly.

---

## üß± Best Practices

* Use **API gateways** to control access to services.
* Implement **eventual consistency** using **sagas** or **event sourcing** where needed.
* Use **domain-driven design (DDD)** to define clear service boundaries.
* Ensure **data ownership** is respected: only the owning service can modify its data.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use Database per Service

* You are adopting **microservices architecture**.
* Services must be independently deployable and scalable.
* Your application needs high service autonomy and loose coupling.

---

## ‚ùå When to Avoid

* You are using a **monolithic** or **modular monolith** architecture.
* You have strong **transactional consistency** requirements across domains.
* Your team lacks the capacity to manage multiple data stores.

## üß© Comparison with Other Patterns

| Pattern                                   | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Database**                       | All services use a single database; easier consistency but tightly coupled.           |
| **Database per Service**                  | Each service has its own database; promotes isolation but needs careful coordination. |
| **Schema per Service (within shared DB)** | Single DB, but each service has its schema; middle-ground solution.                   |

## üìå Summary

The **Database per Service** pattern is ideal for microservices where autonomy, scalability, and flexibility are essential. It comes with complexity around data consistency and cross-service queries but supports a robust and resilient architecture when implemented correctly.
